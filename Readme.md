QuestPhone is an open-source Android productivity utility designed to help users reduce screen addiction by regulating app usage through a gamified experience. The application blocks distracting apps and unlocks them only once the user completes all their work. It was started on April 2024 with the name of DigipawFull and now being continued as QuestPhone.
