## üîê Setting Up Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to manage sensitive information like Supabase keys securely.

To run the app locally:

1. Create a file named `local.properties` in the **root** of the project (same level as your `build.gradle` file).
2. Add the following content to it:

   ```properties
   SUPABASE_URL=https://yourproject.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_API_KEY=your-secret-api-key
   ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Never commit your `local.properties` file. It is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

PRO-TIP
: You can fill in these keys with random values if you decide to debug the app without logging in. Altho Make sure to switch onto fdroid variant

These values will be automatically injected into `BuildConfig` and accessed in Kotlin like this:

```kotlin
val url = BuildConfig.SUPABASE_URL
val apiKey = BuildConfig.SUPABASE_API_KEY
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tips for Contributors

* Open an issue first if you're planning a major change.
* Keep pull requests focused and limited to a single change.
* Run and test the app before submitting a PR.
* Be respectful and constructive in discussions.
